# ResizeMe

A silly Swing game that involves resizing the window. To play, just run the app and resize the window to fit the
colorful ~~square~~ rectangle.

Concept shamelessly stolen from [Super Resize Me](http://www.maximin.tv/srm/).

**Disclaimer:** I wrote this code a long time ago, and as such, it may be terrible.

cool).
